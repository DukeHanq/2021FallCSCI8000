<begin>	a close up of a black and white bird	Shield	Crystal Shield	 A fully crystallized straight shield. How such a weapon was created is entirely unknown. The crystallization boosts its defense, but makes the shield brittle. The shield cannot be used for long, as it cannot be repaired.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white tie	Shield	Dragon Crest Shield	 Shield of a nameless knight, likely a high-ranked knight of Astora. One of the enchanted blue shields. The dragon crest shield greatly reduces fire damage.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a black and white frisbee	Shield	Gargoyle's Shield	 Bronze shield of the gargoyle guarding the Bell of Awakening in the Undead Church. The gargoyle's skin is tough by itself, and perhaps its shield may have been a prop, for it is a rare example of a metal shield that does not reduce physical damage 100%.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up shot of a black and white <unk>	Shield	Grass Crest Shield	 Old medium metal shield of unknown origin. The grass crest is lightly imbued with magic, which slightly speeds stamina recovery.   	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a red and blue tie	Shield	Knight Shield	 This medium metal shield is elegantly carved and painted. Although it is thought to have been used by ancient knights of nobility, its defense and capabilities are similar to other shields.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a brown and black face	Shield	Large Leather Shield	 Large, leather-covered round shield. Choice shield for hunters. Wood shields are lighter than metal shields, but with lower physical damage reductions, and reduced shield stability.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a tennis racket on a tennis court	Shield	Sunlight Shield	 Shield of Solaire of Astora, Knight of Sunlight. Decorated with a holy symbol, but Solaire illustrated it himself, and it has no divine powers of its own. As it turns out, Solaire's incredible prowess is a product of his own training, and nothing else.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white vase	Shield	Tower Kite Shield	 Medium metal shield. Decorated with a tower, the symbol of protection. A standard, widely-used shield.   	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a person holding a skateboard	Shield	Black Iron Greatshield	 Greatshield of the mighty knight Tarkus. Built of special black iron and even heavier than Knight Berenike's tower shield. Especially resistant to fire attacks and effective for shield bashing.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a person holding an umbrella	Shield	Bonewheel Shield	 Giant wooden wheel encircled by spikes. Half-melded to a strange skeleton. Can be used as a greatshield, only for the great gaps. But at least the spikes turn into weapons with a good spin. Strange indeed!  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white background	Shield	Cleansing Greatshield	 The steel greatshield used by Knight Artorias, who succumbed to the Abyss. Artorias, deeply scarred by the Abyss, used this to form a barrier to protect his compatriot Sif. Although this drained the shield, its magic defense remains high.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white cat	Shield	Eagle Shield	 Greatshield with an eagle design. Lightest and easiest greatshield to handle. Greatshields are very stable, and deflect attacks. But one cannot parry, and instead bashes with the shield.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white object	Shield	Giant Shield	 Greatshield made of bronze and marcasite. Used by the giant sentinels of Anor Londo. Marcasite, or white iron, is effective against non-physical damage, but as the shield is designed for the giant sentineles, its weight is unbearable.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white vase	Shield	Greatshield of Artorias	 Shield born from the soul of the great grey wolf Sif, guardian of the grave of the Abysswalker Knight Artorias. Boasts consistent defense and divine protection against various status effects.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up picture of a tennis racket	Shield	Stone Greatshield	 Mossy round greatshield used by the guardian of the Darkroot garden, the Stone Knight. The Stone Knight is a creation of ancient magic, and this shield is imbued with the same power, but is also extremely heavy.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a tennis racket on a black background	Shield	Benhart's Parma	 Small shield of Benhart of Jugo. This parma, emblazoned with a family crest of some sort, has clearly been around for several generations, but has no special value.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of an apple in a bowl	Shield	Buckler	 A traditional small metal shield. Small shields are very light and easy to use, but have low stability when attacked. The center of a buckler is convex, designed to brush attacks aside, making parrying easier. 	<end>
<begin>	a close up of an umbrella on a black background	Shield	Cleric's Parma	 A parma used by clerics on pilgrimage. Enchanted with a somewhat fragile blessing that allows spells to be deflected by parrying.

Enchanted with a somewhat fragile blessing that allows spells to be deflected by parrying. Specially-crafted to provide extra durability and some level of physical defense.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a tennis racket on a tennis court	Shield	Crimson Parma	 A standard wooden parma. The fancy name and nifty paint are surely a merchant's efforts to make this very ordinary shield more attractive.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a toothbrush on a black surface	Shield	Cursed Bone Shield	 Small shield used by Aldian warlocks. Reinforced by a covert ritual that granted the shield the power of flame. Can deflect spells by parrying. The peculiar figure known as Lord Aldia kept Giants in his manor, and attempted to recreate a dragon, but after some time, was not heard from again.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a baseball glove on a black background	Shield	Foot Soldier Shield	 A small shield used by Drangleic foot soldiers. A clearly makeshift shield that does not offer significant defense. The only advantage of this shield is that it makes parrying easier.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bird on a bed	Shield	Golden Falcon Shield	 Small shield used by Volgen Falconers. Appears like a glistening gold falcon from afar. Domestic Volgen soldiers are infamously timid, so it is no wonder that this fierce band of mercenary falconers was hired to compensate. The falconers are rumored to be untrusting of others, and demanding of prompt, full payment. But no wonder; they deliver much more than they are paid, and are well aware of it. 	<end>
<begin>	a black and white photo of a clock	Shield	Iron Parma	 A small shield made of iron. The unusual design suggests a foreign origin. Lightweight despite its iron construction, and sturdy despite its small size, but not sufficient to protect one from real danger.  	<end>

<begin>	a black and white photo of a tennis racket	Shield	Manikin Shield	 A shield used by the manikins of Harvest Valley. The peculiar art of puppetry is a vestige of the two lost lands. The Queen, entranced by poison, used it to beckon unknowing souls to the defiled valley.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a frisbee on a black background	Shield	Phoenix Parma	 A small shield decorated with a phoenix. The sea of flame that swallowed the Iron Keep took this shield as well, but when it was retrieved it was mysteriously unscathed, save a degree of discoloration.  	<end>
<begin>	a black and white photo of an umbrella	Shield	Sanctum Shield	 A shield with a curious design. One of the treasures of the Sunken King. A mixture of mystical tree branch and sacred chime iron allows this shield to serve as a catalyst for miracles and sorceries. Most of the miracles and sorceries created in the Sanctum City were lost, but the quality of their armor and shields suggests highly advanced craftsmanship. 	<end>
<begin>	a black and white photo of a stuffed animal	Shield	Slumbering Dragon Shield		<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bird in a bowl	Shield	Small Leather Shield	 Small, leather-covered round shield. A particularly traditional type of small shield. Small shields are very light and easy to use, but not very stable when attacked.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a yellow and black frisbee	Shield	Sunlight Parma	 A small shield depicting a hero of yore. Perhaps these famed champions are no more, or perhaps they have no desire appear in public view. But their very absence has made tales of their brave deeds all the more alluring, and this shield memorializes one of their brethren. 	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bowl on a table	Shield	Target Shield	 Small metal shield with protrusions. Small shields are very light and easy to use, but are not very stable when attacked. The protrusions on the center of the shield are designed to brush attacks aside and make parrying easier. 	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a vase on a black background	Shield	Archdrake Shield	 Shield of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. The dragon was engraved for ritual purposes, but the shield itself is highly functional. The secrets of Lindelt rituals are protected by the Archdrake sect, and only a select few are given access to their canon of knowledge, which includes the truthful origins of the Archdrake sect itself.  	<end>
<begin>	a chocolate cake sitting on top of a table	Shield	Bell Keeper Shield	 A wooden parma issued to bell keepers.  Very light, and requiring hardly any strength. The bells symbolize forbidden love; the bell keepers, their faithful guardians, ever-ready to annihilate trespassers. They will stand watch, for ever and ever, these determined, if ill-fated, marionettes. 	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the air	Shield	Black Dragon Shield	 A shield that appears in ancient legends. Strangely shaped, and said to be crafted from the talons of the black dragon.

<begin>	a close up of a vase with flowers on it	Shield	Black Flamestone Parma	 A small shield affixed with a black crystal. Found deep inside the Gutter, in the Black Gulch. Heavier than a standard small shield but the hard crystal boosts its defense against slashing. Some of the more determined souls exiled to the Gutter sought to scale the walls of the forsaken place and walk the earth once again, but failed, and wasted away mired in misery and resentment.  	<end>
<begin>	a chocolate cake that is on a piece of tin foil	Shield	Blossom Kite Shield	 A rare shield depicting a blossoming flower, that soothes the weary heart of its bearer.

<begin>	a close up of a vase on a black background	Shield	Bound Wooden Shield	 A shield with an unusual design.  Found in the Undead Purgatory.

<begin>	a close up of a cat on a table	Shield	Porcine Shield	 A strangely porcine shield. The pig head looks eerily authentic, but it is an imitation. Though the shield's defensive capacity is ordinary, it may spook an unsuspecting foe.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a vase on a black background	Shield	Royal Kite Shield	 A metal shield issued to knights. Nothing special about this shield, which is precisely why it is so easy to use, and the likely reason for its popularity.

The brutish and mighty Primal Knights wield this shield as if it were made of paper, but to the ordinary warrior it is a chore to even hold up, owing to its great weight.

<begin>	a black and white photo of a black vase	Shield	Pate's Shield	 Pate's favorite greatshield.

Especially if you have something to hide.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a vase on a black surface	Shield	Pursuer's Greatshield	 Greatshield of the Pursuer. For those who can handle the weight of this shield, it offers resistance to curses.

Ricard's exploits are told in a monomyth. He was born into royalty, but wandered the lands in a fateful ill-conceived journey. He became Undead, and disappeared up North.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a street sign with a sky background	Weapon	Velka's Rapier	 A symbolic, powerful thrusting sword used by the pardoner serving Velka, Goddess of Sin.

<begin>	a black and white image of a street sign	Weapon	Iaito	 Katana forged in an Eastern land. The Katana is drawn from the scabbard at lightning speed, using an Iaijutsu technique. Iaijutsu allows the wielder to charge forward to swiftly cut down distant foes.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a bird in a dark background	Weapon	Butcher Knife	 Giant butcher knife wielded by the Undead man-eating cook lurking in the Depths.

<begin>	a close up of a bird perched on a pole	Weapon	Golem Axe	 An Axe born from the soul of the Iron Golem, guardian of Sen's Fortress who repelled countless heroes who sought Anor Londo. Its powerful one-handed attack imitates the golem's blade of wind, but the heavy iron blade makes it quite unwieldy.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a street sign in the dark	Weapon	Hand Axe	 Small hand axe. Appears identical to a lumberjack's tool, but has ideal weight and strength, and is easy to handle. One wrong swing leaves the wielder wide open, so timing and proximity to the enemy must be judged carefully.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a pair of scissors	Weapon	Black Knight Greataxe	 Greataxe of the black knights who wander Lordran. Used to face chaos demons. The large motion that puts the weight of the body into the attack reflects the great size of their adversaries long ago.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a street sign with a blurry background	Weapon	Greataxe	 This greataxe is a veritable mass of iron.

<begin>	a close up of a black and white cat	Weapon	Stone Greataxe	 Greataxe borne by the stone knights who guard the forest Sanctuary. This greataxe, requiring inhuman strength to wield and more fitted to manual labor than battle, is nevertheless completely lethal.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a street light on a pole	Weapon	Channeler's Trident	 Trident of the Six-eyed Channelers, sorcerers who serve Seath the Scaleless in collecting human specimens. Thrusted in circular motions in a unique martial arts dance that stirs nearby allies into a bloodthirsty frenzy.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a street light in the dark	Weapon	Partizan	 Spear with a blade attached to a broad point. Boasts long reach, and can slice. The wide range of this spear makes it adaptable to many situations. Its strength lies in its length, but in cramped quarters, this backfires, and slices ricochet off walls.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a traffic light on a black background	Weapon	Pike	 Long spear with a very long red hilt. Traditionally used by groups of soldiers. Specially designed for distance thrusting. Has the longest range of all non-projectile weapons, but its very length makes it somewhat difficult to handle.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the air	Weapon	Silver Knight Spear	 The silver knights of Anor Londo guard the city using this beautifully slender weapon. The spear can be wielded by both hands in a focused thrust that uses one's body weight, or swung in a large sweeping motion.  	<end>

Effective against hard exteriors, and hits for high damage at the right moment of an enemy's swing. But the hit radius is small, and it is easily blocked by shields.   	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a pair of scissors	Weapon	Giant's Halberd	 Large halberd made of old brass, used by the giant sentinels of Anor Londo. Brass contains traces of lightning, but as the halberd is designed for the giant sentinels, its weight is unbearable.  	<end>
<begin>	a black and white photo of an airplane	Weapon	Great Scythe	 Weapon with a long curved blade. Converted from a wheat-harvesting tool. The magnificent sharp curved blade instills fear in opponents. Perhaps it is their survival instinct at work.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a person holding a tennis racket	Weapon	Halberd	 Long-hilted weapon mixing spear and axe is difficult to handle, requiring both strength and dexterity.

<begin>	a close up of a street sign on a pole	Weapon	Lucerne	 Halberd with a large, hard beak-like protrusion. Inflicts thrust damage. Instead of thrusting like a spear, the wielder of the Lucerne aims to club the head with its hard beak.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a tennis racket in the dark	Weapon	Scythe	 Halberd with a large blade. Scythe adjusted for battle. Designed especially for slicing. However, one false swing leaves one wide open.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the air	Weapon	Club	 A simple wooden club. This simple bladeless strike weapon is effective against most foes, is easily handled, and can break the guard of a shield. However, a single miss makes one wide open, so timing and proximities are crucial.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a black and white street	Weapon	Mace	 Iron hammer with a protrusive pommel. Standard weapon for clerics. This simple bladeless strike weapon is effective against most foes, and can break the guard of a shield. However, one miss leaves one wide open.   	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a street sign in the dark	Weapon	Pickaxe	 Traditionally a mining tool, but the hard cone of the pommel is effective in battle. A downward swing of the Pickaxe can crush stone; a human head would be an afterthought.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a street sign with a blurry background	Weapon	Reinforced Club	 A club with leather nailed to the pommel. The burg Undead merchant proudly peddles this club, but its reinforcement is shoddy. Indeed, its attack is stronger, but the club is no longer dependably sturdy.   	<end>
<begin>	a black and white image of a street sign	Weapon	Warpick	 Hammer with a large beak-shaped pommel. Originally a pickaxe; redesigned for battle. This simple but deadly weapon hits heavily with thrust damage, such that it easily cracks metal armor.  	<end>

<begin>	a black and white photo of a street sign	Weapon	Grant	 A legendary weapon of the Way of White, granted to an Undead paladin long ago. This mass of iron can only be lifted by those with inhuman strength, but it is blessed, and very effective against agents of Dark.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a black and white photo	Weapon	Smough's Hammer	 Great hammer from the soul of executioner Smough, who guards the cathedral in the forsaken city of Anor Londo.

<begin>	a black and white photo of a cat	Weapon	Bandit's Knife	 This wide single-edged shortsword is the favorite of lowly thieves and bandits. Primarily a slicing weapon, but highly effective when used for critical hits, such as after parrying or from behind.  	<end>

<begin>	a black and white photo of a cat	Weapon	Priscilla's Dagger	 This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons, came from the tail of Priscilla, the Dragon Crossbreed in the painted world of Ariamis. Possessing the power of lifehunt, it dances about when wielded, in a fashion reminiscent of the white-robed painting guardians.  	<end>
<begin>	a black bird sitting on top of a black background	Weapon	Caestus	 The weapon augments one's bare hands with thick, studded leather. The Caestus has a short reach, but quickly cools down. Amount of damage inflicted is dependent on its wearer's strength.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the sky	Weapon	Claw	 A weapon formed by three sharped claws. Attacks cause bleeding, and the wounds inflicted are not easily mended. Preferred weapon of the spooks of an Eastern land.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a red rose in a vase	Weapon	Dark Hand	 The Darkwraiths, incited by Kaathe, use the power of the dark soul to absorb humanity, an art shared by this weapon, which also acts as a special shield.

<begin>	a close up of a bird on a black background	Weapon	Dragon Bone Fist	 A weapon from the soul of the Iron Golem, guardian of Sen's Fortress who repelled countless heroes who sought Anor Londo. The Gods fused the power of the soul with the great bones of the dragons, forming an appropriate core for the giant golem.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a black and white animal	Weapon	Guardian Tail	 Sliced tail of the Sanctuary Guardian. This flexible, spiked and highly poisonous tail would make a rather obnoxious weapon.  	<end>
<begin>	a black and white photo of a tennis racket	Weapon	Notched Whip	 Whip with sharp spikes. Only slightly effective against armor and tough scales, but quite formidable against enemies with exposed skin. Also causes heavy bleeding.  	<end>

<begin>	a couple of planes flying in the dark	Weapon	Darkmoon Bow	 Bow born from the soul of the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over the abandoned city of Gods, Anor Londo. This golden bow is imbued with powerful magic and is most impressive with Moonlight Arrows.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a street sign on a pole	Weapon	Avelyn	 Repeating crossbow cherished by the weapon craftsman Eidas. Its elaborate design makes it closer to a work of art than a weapon. Intricate mechanism makes heavy damage possible through triple-shot firing of bolts, but in fact each bolt inflicts less damage.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a giraffe in a dark background	Weapon	Heavy Crossbow	 Powerful large crossbow. While bows require both hands, a crossbow is held in one, but arming each bolt takes time. Equip bolts to use. Press L2/R2 to change type of bolt.  	<end>

<begin>	a close up of a shadow of a person in the dark	Weapon	Manus Catalyst	 A sorcery catalyst born from the soul of Manus, father of the Abyss.

<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the air	Weapon	Tin Banishment Catalyst	 Catalyst of the banishment sorcerers who flooded New Londo to seal off away the Darkwraiths and the Kings who fell to Dark. In contrast to other catalysts, the metal catalyst qualifies as a weapon, as it inflicts physical damage, however small.   	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a street sign with a blurry background	Weapon	Tin Crystallization Catalyst	 Catalyst imbued in terrifying crystal magic. Used by Logan after his fixation on Seath. Makes all sorceries incredibly powerful, but demands extremely high intelligence from its wielder, and halves sorcery usages.  	<end>
<begin>	a close up of a traffic light on a black background	Weapon	Tin Darkmoon Catalyst	 Catalyst born from the soul of the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over the abandoned city of Gods, Anor Londo.

<begin>	an airplane flying high in the sky at night	Weapon	Blacksteel Katana	 Blacksteel katana wielded by Alonne Knights. One of the sturdiest types of katana, preferred by masters of the quick-draw. In the heyday of his land, the Old Iron King fancied entertaining dubious and eccentric guests from faraway lands.

<begin>	a close up of a bird flying in the dark	Weapon	Chaos Blade	 A katana of unknown origin. Damage to foes also damages its owner. The peculiar pattern upon the blade suggests the sinister nature of this cursed blade. It is an alluring vortex, and a lonely soul. Effect: attacks also damage the player. 	<end>
<begin>	a bird that is flying in the air	Weapon	Darkdrift	 Katana of Grave Warden Agdayne. Has a crystal-clear blade and a strong attack that slices through enemy shields.
