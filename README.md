These codes involve the training and use of several deep learning models from simple to difficult. You can download and use any part if you want.

The first part of the code refers to the open source materials on the Internet. 
Here is how I train model 1.

The second part of the code refers to the open source code from https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning.
Here is how I train model 2.
