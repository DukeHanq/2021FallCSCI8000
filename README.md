These codes involve the training and use of several deep learning models from simple to difficult. You can download and use any part if you want.
The first part of the code refers to the open source materials on the Internet. 
The second part of the code refers to the open source code from https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning.
The third part of the code use API from tensorflow. These three parts are trained and used independently of each other.
